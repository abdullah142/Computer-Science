Mad Libs is a phrasal template word game where one player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story, before reading the – often comical or nonsensical – story aloud. The game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime.
Consider the story file for this assignment:

“If some one loves a flower of which just one example exists among all the millions and millions of stars, that’s enough to make him happy when he looks at the stars. He tells himself, “My flower is up there somewhere. . . .” But if the sheep eats the flower, then for him it’s as if, suddenly, all the stars went out. And that isn’t important?” Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince
Here is the template for the Mid Lab:

“If some one [verb] a [name of a plant] of which just one example exists among all the millions and millions of [a thing that exits very often], that’s enough to make him [adjective for feelings] when he [verb] at the [any noun in plural]. He tells himself, “My [name of a plant] is up there somewhere. . . .” But if the [an animal] [verb] the flower, then for him it’s as if, suddenly, all the stars went out. And that isn’t important?”

In the above template keywords are replaced with blanks—the text enclosed in square brackets—represent a specific lexical or category, such as “noun", “verb", “place", “part of body". Your program should prompt the user to contribute a word for a specific type for each blank without revealing the context of the word. Finally, print out your “mad lib" result!
